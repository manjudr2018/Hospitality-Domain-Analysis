# Hospitality Domain Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This repository hosts my personal project, the Hospitality Domain Analysis Dashboard, a Power BI-based solution designed to analyze sales data for AtliQ Grands over a three-month period. As part of my self-directed learning in data analytics, I aimed to uncover insights into revenue trends and market share losses, demonstrating my ability to tackle real-world business challenges. This project reflects my commitment to leveraging data visualization for strategic decision-making in the hospitality sector.

## Project Objectives
The core objectives of this project were to:
- Analyze three months of sales data to identify revenue and market share trends.
- Provide actionable insights to support a projected 20% recovery in revenue and market share.
- Enhance my skills in data interpretation and dashboard development using Power BI and Excel.
- Offer a practical tool for revenue teams to address operational inefficiencies.

## Technical Details
The project utilized the following technologies and tools:
- **Power BI**: Employed for creating interactive dashboards and visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs).
- **Excel**: Used for initial data cleaning and preliminary analysis before importing into Power BI.
- **Data Sources**: A mock dataset representing AtliQ Grands’ sales, including revenue, occupancy rates, and market share metrics.
- **Methodologies**: Applied data cleaning, trend analysis, and KPI visualization techniques to ensure accuracy and usability.

## Implementation
The development process followed these steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered a sample dataset covering three months of sales for AtliQ Grands.
2. **Data Preparation**: Cleaned data in Excel to remove inconsistencies and prepared it for Power BI integration.
3. **Dashboard Creation**: Designed visuals such as line charts and pie graphs to display revenue trends and loss causes.
4. **Insight Generation**: Identified root causes of revenue decline, proposing a 20% recovery strategy based on data patterns.
5. **Validation**: Shared the dashboard with peers for feedback, refining it to improve clarity and impact.

## Key Achievements
- Delivered a dashboard that highlighted revenue loss causes, supporting a potential 20% recovery within a month.
- Strengthened my expertise in Power BI and Excel, focusing on trend analysis and data storytelling.
- Demonstrated the ability to translate complex data into actionable business recommendations.
- Gained confidence in presenting data-driven solutions to simulated stakeholders.

## Challenges Faced
A major challenge was interpreting noisy data with missing values, which required iterative cleaning. Balancing detailed insights with a user-friendly design was also tricky, but peer reviews helped refine the output. Learning to align business goals with technical execution was a valuable lesson.

## Future Improvements
Future enhancements could include:
- Adding predictive analytics to forecast future revenue trends.
- Integrating real-time data feeds for dynamic updates.
- Expanding the dashboard to include customer satisfaction metrics for a broader analysis.
